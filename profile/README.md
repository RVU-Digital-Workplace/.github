2.  **Fork the Repository:** Once you've chosen an issue (or had your new issue approved), fork the project repository to your own GitHub account.
3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes (e.g., `feature/your-feature` or `fix/the-issue`).
4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your feature, fix the bug, or improve the documentation.
5.  **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes work as expected and don't break existing functionality.
6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear and concise commit messages on the changes or features added.
7.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository.
8.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Open a PR from your branch to the `main` branch of the original project repository. Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR, link any relevant issues, and someone from the team will review it.
